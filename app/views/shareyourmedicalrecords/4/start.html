        You can choose parts of your medical records and share them with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).
      <p>

      <p>
        This could help you to get a faster and more accurate decision.

      <p>
        It might mean you don’t need a face to face appointment with an assessor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anything you choose to share will only be used for your Employment and Support Allowance claim. 
      </p>
        
        <p>
          Your information won’t be used for anything else, or shared with anyone else.
